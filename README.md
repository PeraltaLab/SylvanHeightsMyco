# SylvanHeightsMyco
This repository contains open-source code, data, & text files.

Raw amplicon sequence files can be found at NCBI SRA [BioProject].

## We address the following aim:

* **Aim:** To characterize environmental microbiomes collected from surface and ground water samples at Sylvan Heights Bird Park in 2017.

### Repo Contents

* **analyses:** An R Markdown file that includes R script written by Foote, Balakrishnan, and Peralta.

* **bin:** 
	* *MothurTools.R*: An R script written by [Dr. Mario E. Muscarella](Mario.E.Muscarella@gmail.com) [(website)](https://muscarellalab.github.io/) containing functions used in the analysis of community sequence data.

* **data:** Files associated with amplicon data sets. 

* **figures:** Figures (microbes-16S rRNA amplicon) generated according to R script located in R Markdown file.

* **mothur:** Files containing script for bioinformatic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences (Illumina MiSeq platform) using mothur pipeline.
